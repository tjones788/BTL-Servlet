Our approach also facilitates the identification of regions with unequal representation of two alleles and other poorly sequenced regions. The availability of confidence scores allows for a principled combination of sequencing results from multiple samples."],			"bio_tags": ["Population genetics","SNP discovery"],			"language": ["Perl","R","Python"]		}
