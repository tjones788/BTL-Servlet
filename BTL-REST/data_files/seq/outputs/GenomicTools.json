A variety of mathematical operations between sets of genomic regions is implemented thereby enabling the prototyping of computational pipelines that can address a wide spectrum of tasks from preprocessing and quality control to meta-analyses. More specifically, the user can easily create average read profiles across transcriptional start sites or enhancer sites, quickly prototype customized peak discovery methods for ChIP-seq experiments, perform genome-wide statistical tests such as enrichment analyses, design controls via appropriate randomization schemes, among other applications."],			"bio_tags": ["Genomics","ChIP-Seq","RNA-Seq"],			"meth_tags": ["Genomic overlaps","Peak detection","Profiles","Heatmaps"],			"features": ["create custom pipelines","feature overlaps","identify binding site peaks in ChIP-seq data","create read profiles","create read heatmaps"],			"language": ["C","C++"],			"licence": ["GPL 2"]		}
