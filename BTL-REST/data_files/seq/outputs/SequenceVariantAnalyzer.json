Compared with previous discovery strategies, a whole-genome sequencing study is no longer constrained by differing patterns of linkage disequilibrium, thus, in theory, is more possible to directly identify the gentic variants contributing to biological traits or medical outcomes.\nThe rapidly evolving high-throughput DNA sequencing technologies have now allowed the fast generation of large amount of sequence data for the purpose of performing such whole-genome sequencing studies, at a reasonable cost. SequenceVariantAnalyzer, or SVA, is a software tool that we have been developing to analyze the genetic variants identified from such studies.\nURL: http:\/\/www.svaproject.org\/"],			"bio_tags": ["Personal genomics","Genomics","Sequence analysis"],			"meth_tags": ["Annotation","Genetic variation annotation","Genome browser"],			"features": ["Variant annotation and analysis"],			"language": ["Java"],			"os": ["Linux 64"]		}
