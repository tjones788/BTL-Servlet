OLego adopts a seeding and extension scheme, and does not rely on a separate external mapper. It achieves high sensitivity of junction detection by using very small seeds (12-14 nt), efficiently mapped using Burrows-Wheeler transform (BWT) and FM-index. This also makes it particularly sensitive for discovering small exons. It is implemented in C++ with full support of multiple threading, to allow fast processing of large-scale data."],			"bio_tags": ["Genomics","RNA-Seq","RNA-Seq Alignment"],			"meth_tags": ["Mapping","Alignment"],			"features": ["capable of using very small seeds for splice mapping","but still fast and accurate"],			"language": ["C++"],			"licence": ["GPLv3"],			"os": ["Linux","Linux 64","Mac OS X"]		}
