It predicts SVs from discordant read pairs (pairs that mapped to reference genome in unexpected\nway). Then it looks for reads that cover the predicted breakpoints junctions (split read support), refines\nbreakpoints by local alignments and predicts mechanisms that SVs are formed. It is more sensitive,\nwith remapping of unmapped and partially mapped reads, especially when the insert size of sequencing\nlibrary is small (i.e. read lenght of 100bp and insert size is 200bp), since the SV breakpoint has to be\ninbetween the paired end reads to form discordant read pair. With discordant read pair, split read\nsupport and some filtering steps, it has low false positive rate. It can also take into account of reads\nfrom repetitive regions (non-uniquely mapped), combine discordant read pair clusters to predict\ncomplex events, and select the most supported and smallest events."],			"bio_tags": ["Structural variation"],			"meth_tags": ["Structural variation discovery"]		}
