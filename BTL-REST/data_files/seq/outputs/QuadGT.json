Genotypes are inferred using a joint model of parental variant frequencies, de novo germline mutations, and somatic mutations. The model quantifies the descent-by-modification relationships between the unknown genotypes by using a set of parameters in a Bayesian inference setting."],			"bio_tags": ["SNPs"],			"meth_tags": ["SNP calling","Variant Calling"],			"language": ["Java"]		}
