BiQ Analyzer HT facilitates the processing, quality control and initial analysis of single-basepair resolution DNA methylation data. It was developed for deep bisulfite sequencing of one or more loci using the Roche 454 platform, but it easily extends to other sequencing platforms. BiQ Analyzer HT features a biologist-friendly graphical user interface, a fast alignment algorithm and a variety of ways to visualize DNA methylation data."],			"bio_tags": ["Epigenomics","DNA methylation","Bisulfite Sequencing"],			"language": ["Java"],			"os": ["Windows","Linux","Mac OS X","Solaris"]		}
