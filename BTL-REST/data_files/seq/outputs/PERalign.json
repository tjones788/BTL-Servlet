Starting from possible exonic and spliced alignments of all end reads, our method constructs potential splicing paths connecting paired ends. An expectation maximization method assigns likelihood values to all splice junctions and assigns the most probable alignment for each transcript fragment."],			"bio_tags": ["RNA-Seq Alignment"],			"language": ["C++"],			"os": ["Linux"]		}
