MethPipe provides tools for mapping bisulfite sequencing read and estimating methylation levels at individual cytosine sites. Additionally, MethPipe includes tools for identifying higher-level methylation features, such as hypo-methylated regions (HMR), partially methylated domains (PMD), hyper-methylated regions (HyperMR), and allele-specific methylated regions (AMR)."],			"bio_tags": ["Epigenomics","DNA methylation","Bisulfite Sequencing"],			"meth_tags": ["Bisulfite mapping"],			"language": ["C++"],			"licence": ["GPL (&gt;= 3)"],			"os": ["Linux","Mac OS X"]		}
