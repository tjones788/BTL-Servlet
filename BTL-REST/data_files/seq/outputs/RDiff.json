It implements two statistical tests to detect changes of the RNA processing between two samples. rDiff.parametric is a powerful test, which can be applied for well annotated organisms to detect changes in the relative abundance of isoforms. rDiff.nonparametric is an alternative when the annotation is incomplete or missing."],			"bio_tags": ["Alternative Splicing","RNA-Seq","Transcriptomics"],			"meth_tags": ["Alignment","Differential expression"],			"language": ["Python","Matlab"],			"licence": ["Open Source"],			"os": ["Linux","Mac OS X"]		}
