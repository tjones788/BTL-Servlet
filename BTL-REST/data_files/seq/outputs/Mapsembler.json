It takes as input a set of NGS raw reads and a set of input sequences (starters). It first determines if each starter is read-coherent, e.g. whether reads confirm the presence of each starter in the original sequence. Then for each read-coherent starter, Mapsembler outputs its sequence neighborhood as a linear sequence or as a graph, depending on the user choice."],			"bio_tags": ["Metagenomics","Transcriptomics","DNA-Seq","RNA-Seq Quantitation","Targeted assembly"],			"meth_tags": ["Assembly","Micro assembly","Mapping"],			"features": ["De novo assembly","Identify Novel Exons","Remove contaminants","Detect enzymes in metagenomics NGS reads"],			"language": ["C"],			"licence": ["CeCILL"],			"os": ["Linux"]		}
