It also implements a systematic workflow for design, optimization and (computational) validation of DNA methylation biomarkers. This workflow starts from a preselected differentially methylated region (DMR) and results in an optimized DNA methylation assay that is ready to be tested in a large-scale clinical trial."],			"bio_tags": ["Epigenomics","DNA methylation"],			"language": ["Java"],			"os": ["Windows","Linux","Mac OS X","Solaris"]		}
