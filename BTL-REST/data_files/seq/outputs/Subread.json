{"author": "","hits": "584","label": "Subread",			"summary": ["Subread is a general-purpose read aligner which can be used to map both genomic DNA-seq reads and RNA-seq reads. It uses a new mapping paradigm called \"seed-and-vote\" to achieve fast, accurate and scalable read mapping. It automatically determines if a read should be globally or locally aligned, therefore particularly powerful in mapping RNA-seq reads. It supports indel detection and can map reads with both fixed and variable lengths."],			"bio_tags": ["Next Generation Sequencing","RNA-Seq Alignment","Read alignment"],			"meth_tags": ["Read mapping","Whole genome resequencing"],			"features": ["Gapped alignment","Local alignment","Memory efficient and fast","Paired read support","RNAseq analysis","SAM format output","SNP\/indel discovery in any format","can run on major computer platforms","capable of using very small seeds for splice mapping","low cost for high-error matching","paired-end mapping","parallel execution","short and long reads"],			"language": ["C"],			"licence": ["GPL v3"],			"os": ["Linux 64","Mac OS X","Mac OS X; x86 64"]		}
