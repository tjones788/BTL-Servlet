For genome assembly the problem of generating a draft assembly (i.e. a set of unordered contigs) has now been very well addressed - but for users who need high quality assemblies for their analyses there are still unresolved issues: this is where PAGIT is used. \""],			"bio_tags": ["De novo assembly"],			"meth_tags": ["De-novo assembly","Quality Control","Assembly quality evaluation"],			"os": ["Linux"]		}
