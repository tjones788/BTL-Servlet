It adopts a heuristic method in searching for local mapping signatures created by insertion\/deletions (indels) or more complex structural variants(SVs). With current NGS single-end sequencing data, the output regions by Breakpoint mainly contain the approximate breakpoints of indels and a limited number of large SVs."],			"bio_tags": ["Exome and Whole genome variant detection","InDel discovery"],			"meth_tags": ["Statistical testing"],			"language": ["C++","Perl"],			"licence": ["GPL"]		}
