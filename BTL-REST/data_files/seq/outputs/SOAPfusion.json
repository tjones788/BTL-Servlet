The tool follows a different strategy by \u201cfinding fusions directly and verifying them\u201d, differentiating it from all other existing tools by \u201cfinding the candidate regions and searching for the fusions afterwards\u201d. This enables the fusion discovery process to be more effective and sensitive, also with a specular performance under low coverage of sequencing far more better than other tools.\nhttp:\/\/soap.genomics.org.cn\/SOAPfusion.html"],			"bio_tags": ["Transcriptome","RNA-Seq"],			"meth_tags": ["Gene fusions discovery."],			"features": ["finding fusions directly and verifying them"],			"language": ["Perl","C++"],			"os": ["Linux 64"]		}
