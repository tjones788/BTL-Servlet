Samscope uses multiple layers to simultaneously (or sequentially) view SAM\/BAM related features like coverage or allele frequency, or ChIP-SEQ features like polarity from as many files as you like. The paging-friendly binary file layout makes it feasible to browse data sets far larger than the system's available RAM."],			"bio_tags": ["ChIP-Seq","RNA-Seq","Genomics"],			"meth_tags": ["Visualization","Read mapping","SAMtools"],			"language": ["C++"],			"licence": ["AGPL"],			"os": ["POSIX","Linux"]		}
